Hello and welcome to the "Variables" lesson of your training
I am Zachary Lawton, (Gilbert,) Lead Coder of the 2017/2018 Season
Variables are one of the most fundamental parts of your code

"So, what is a variable?" you may ask
Well, a variable is something that stores information
This information could range from how much money is in your bank account, to if you have ever been to the Grand Canyon

There are many different types of variables in Java
There are two main types of variables: string and numeric

String variables store text. For example, this sentence could be stored as the data in a string variable
The only string variable that exists is quite simply called "String". (Yes, the capital is important)
Strings are mainly useful for two things here at robotics: feedback and logic
Feedback is important to tell us what the robot is currently doing
If for example, the robot is driving forward, than we want the phones to tell us "The robot is driving forward"
That right there is a string! It holds the text as information
Without the stored text information, the phones would not know what to tell us when the robot is driving forward

There are a lot more numeric variables than string variables
As you could guess, numeric variables store numbers
"But if all they do is store numbers, than how come there are so many of them?" I hear you asking
Well, strings actually work by using arrays, (which are basically lists,) that are indexed by the integer variable
This simply means that strings are actually a list, where each character is an item on it
Think of this as a shopping list where you need to buy food
On this list, each item corresponds to a number. Ex. I have four things to get at the store. The second item is "pizza"
However, with a string, instead of your list looking like:
1.cookies
2.pizza
3.pasta
4.brownies

It looks like:
0.c
1.o
2.o
3.k
4.i
5.e
6.s
And so on

As I mentioned before, this list is indexed by the integer variable
The integer variable stores numbers. The integer variable can store numbers anywhere from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
That means that the string can hold over two separate billion letters in it! Because of that, there is only one string variable
However, there are more numeric variables, as it is easier to type out the number 2,147,483,647 than to type two billion letters
"Well than why don't we just use strings to hold numbers?" I sense you thinking
The reason we don't do that is because strings have a trade off
The only way you can compare strings is to see if one has the exact same text as the other
And when I say exact, I mean that with strings, "1" is not the same as "01" or "1.00"
Also, you can only set strings to a certain value
The reason for this is that text can also be stored in a string, and not just numbers
"Hi" is different than "hi" so the code can tell capitals, and because of that, "1" is not the same as "1.00" in strings
Also, it is impossible to compute if "6chicken2 > turkey23," as they are texts and not numbers

With numeric variables, you can compare using >, <, or =, and change the value by increments
For example, you can add "5" to "1" to get "6"
You can also check if "5 > 2" or if "66 > 154"
There are many different types of numeric variables because there are two types of numeric variables
Also, each kind of variable in those categories has a different range of sizes
This is important because if we will only ever be storing numbers up to 10, we don't need to store 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
Doing this saves a lot of space on the computer, and puts less strain on processing

The first kind of numeric variable is one that can not have decimals in it
We use: "boolean," "byte," "short," "int," and "long,"
Here are their ranges:

boolean                          0 :                         1 *Note: booleans are set to false and true, not 0 and 1.
byte	                      -128 :                       127  However, false and true correspond to 0 and 1 behind the scenes of the code*
short	                   -32,768 :                    32,767
int		            -2,147,483,648 :             2,147,483,647
long	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 : 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

The second kind of numeric variable is, as you guessed, one that does have decimals in it
We use: "float" and "double"
Here are their ranges:

float    (positive and negative)    1.40239846 x 10^-45          : 3.40282347 x 10^38
double	 (positive and negative)    4.9406564584124654 x 10^-324 : 1.7976931348623157 x 10^308

Now, you may be wondering, what are the practicalities of some of these variables?
Well, we will find out in the next lesson!

Come back and read through this again after you read the next lesson. Things might start to make more sense!
